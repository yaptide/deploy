# OpenStack yaptide deploy

## The aim

The aim of this project it to provide an automated deploy of the yaptide platform to the OpenStack cloud platform.
The deployment is managed by the ansible playbooks. In this project two major playbooks are used:
 - `cloud_instance.yml` - playbook for creating (and teardown) a cloud instance
 - `site.yml` - main playbook for deploying the yaptide platform

## Instructions

1. Fill the clouds.yaml with credentials needed to access OpenStack cloud

2. Install necessary requirements:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Query the dynamic inventory:

```bash
ansible-inventory --graph
```

To print public IPs of all instances in the dynamic inventory:

```bash
ansible -m debug -a "var=hostvars[inventory_hostname].ansible_host" all
```

4. Create an instance on OpenStack cloud:

This step may take about 3-4 minutes, so be patient. Once it is completed, a machine named `yaptide` will be created on the OpenStack cloud.

```bash
ansible-playbook cloud_instance.yml
```

Once the instance is created, you can run time consuming package upgrade task on it. This step may take about 10-15 minutes, so be patient.

```bash
ansible yaptide -m apt -a "update_cache=yes upgrade=dist" --become
ansible yaptide -m reboot --become
```

In case you have an existing regular or snaphot image, you can use it to create an instance.
This will save you some time, as the image will be used instead of installing all the packages from scratch.

```bash
ansible-playbook cloud_instance.yml -e "image_name='Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Snapshot 20221021'"
```

To get larger flavor, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook cloud_instance.yml -e "flavor_name='h1.large'"
```

For some time we would need to generate a grid proxy. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
export ARES_USERNAME=plgkongruencj
read -s p && echo $p | ssh -l $ARES_USERNAME ares.cyfronet.pl "grid-proxy-init -q -pwstdin && cat /tmp/x509up_u\`id -u\`" > grid_proxy && unset p
```

5. Deploy the yaptide platform on the instance.
At this stage necessary packages will be installed and respective repositories cloned.
The backend will be served on port 5000 and the frontend on port 80.
This step is time consuming and may take more than 10 minutes.

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

To perform deployment on a specific branch, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -e backend_repo_version='backend-branch-name' -e frontend_repo_version='frontend-branch-name'
```

You can also run only few stages of the deployment. For example to perform only installation of necessary packages, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "setup"
```

6. To remove the yaptide platform from the instance, run:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -e mode=clean
```

7. Tear down the instance.

```bash
ansible-playbook cloud_instance.yml -e mode=clean
```
